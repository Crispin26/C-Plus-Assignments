# 📘 C++ Assignments Repository

Welcome to my collection of C++ assignments, projects, and learning exercises.  
This repository includes all the work done during my C++ course — from basic syntax to more advanced concepts like arrays, functions, recursion, object-oriented programming, and file handling.

Each lecture has its own folder with related assignments, properly named and organized for clarity and easy navigation.

## 📁 Projects

| Project        | Description                                            | Week |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------|
| Project 1      | Student Grading System using Arrays (solo)            | 5    |
| Project 2      | Library Management System using Classes & Objects     | 10   |
| Final Project  | Full OOP + File Handling + STL (group work)           | 15   |

All projects include:
- ✅ Requirement Analysis  
- ✅ Design (Flowcharts / Diagrams)  
- ✅ Implementation (C++ Code)  
- ✅ Testing & Debugging  
- ✅ Enhancements / Improvements  


## 💡 How to Use

1. Open any `Lecture_xx` folder to view assignments
2. Each folder includes:
   - ✅ `.cpp` source files
   - ✅ `README.md` for explanations
   - ✅ Optional: flowchart images (in `.png` or `.jpg`)
3. Clone or download repo to run in your preferred C++ environment (I use **VS Code**)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/C-Plus-Assignments.git
````

4. Compile and run using `g++`:

```bash
g++ Ass1_HelloWorld.cpp -o HelloWorld
./HelloWorld


## 📌 Notes

* All code is written in **C++**, using standard input/output and basic libraries.
* Programs are compiled and run using **g++** or VS Code’s built-in terminal.
* Debugging is done with shortcuts like `F10`, `F11` for step-by-step tracing.
* Flowcharts and requirement documents can be added as `.png`, `.jpg`, or `.pdf`.

## 🚀 Learning Process (Assignment Workflow)

For each assignment or project, I follow this structured process:

1. ✍️ Write the **requirement / problem statement**
2. 🔁 Design the **logic** or **flowchart**
3. 👨‍💻 Implement in **C++**
4. 🐛 Debug and Trace using test cases
5. 🧠 Reflect and enhance
